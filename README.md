Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Overview
This repository contains code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is implemented in Python using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
Install the required dependencies using pip:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) and labels corresponding to the digits. It is widely used for training and testing machine learning models.

Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture consists of the following layers:

Convolutional layer with 32 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation function
Max pooling layer with pool size 2x2
Convolutional layer with 64 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation function
Max pooling layer with pool size 2x2
Flatten layer to convert 2D feature maps into a 1D vector
Dense (fully connected) layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation function
Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.5 to prevent overfitting
Output layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit) and softmax activation function
Training
To train the model, run the train.py script:

Copy code
python train.py
The script will load the MNIST dataset, preprocess the data, build the CNN model, train the model on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the test set. Trained model weights will be saved to the models directory.

Evaluation
The evaluate.py script can be used to evaluate the trained model on custom images of handwritten digits:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py path/to/image1 path/to/image2 ...
The script will preprocess the images, feed them to the trained model, and output the predicted digits.

Results
After training, the model achieves an accuracy of over 99% on the MNIST test set.
